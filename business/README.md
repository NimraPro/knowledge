## Finding a good idea
- How can I validate a idea?
  
> Running out of SaaS ideas. Go to Zapier integrations and choose any idea to work on. For example, Tweet.photo did the same - Picked up something that Zapier is already doing - Automatically post your Instagram photos to Twitter - Acquired for $30K ($10K in cash + $20K cap based on sales for next 2 years) - Started in 2018

## Worauf kommt es an?
